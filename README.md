# VSDIAT-Physical_Design-workshop

VLSI System Design Corporation is hosting the "Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130" workshop. In this, we used "Google-Skywater's Opensource 130nm Process Design Kit (PDK)" to build GDSII from the RTL netlist for the PicoRV32a SoC design with Openlane flow. We developed and described our own standard cells using the Sky130 PDK variant. The entire RTL2GDSII flow is automatically executed by OpenLANE. For better timing, timing analysis and optimisation are conducted. Design rule checks are performed as well.
